I am a 𝙘𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙤𝙪𝙨, 𝙚𝙘𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙘, 𝙙𝙞𝙨𝙘𝙧𝙚𝙚𝙩 and 𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙚𝙙 person, 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙮 𝙩𝙤 𝙝𝙚𝙡𝙥 𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙨.
I am that person on whom you can rely on. In a team I am usually the 𝙢𝙚𝙙𝙞𝙖𝙩𝙤𝙧, always ready to share my knowledge in order to grow as a team. 
I think that in a group we are stronger and can reach higher results than alone.
Moreover I am a 𝙝𝙪𝙢𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙛𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙞𝙨𝙩 so I do my best with what I have, I am 𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙣 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙙 and I 𝙡𝙤𝙫𝙚 𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜 and 𝙘𝙤𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜!

After university I realized that I wasn't completely satisfied so I took several steps at the same time in order to find my way. It's how I discovered web development. I've been fascinated by this world from the very first time and I've attended my first full-stack boot camp. It was super intensive and I experienced impostor syndrome. 
I've worked on it and I realized that I've still needed a guide to go on and I focused my attention on front-end.
Doing this journey I've met Strive School and here I am!
