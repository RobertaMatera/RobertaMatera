After my MSc in Architecture, I realized that I wasn't completely satisfied by the idea of that career so I decided to switch off to web development.

I am a 𝙘𝙪𝙧𝙞𝙤𝙪𝙨, 𝙚𝙘𝙡𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙘, 𝙙𝙞𝙨𝙘𝙧𝙚𝙚𝙩 and 𝙧𝙚𝙨𝙚𝙧𝙫𝙚𝙙 person, 𝙘𝙤𝙣𝙨𝙩𝙖𝙣𝙩𝙡𝙮 𝙧𝙚𝙖𝙙𝙮 𝙩𝙤 𝙝𝙚𝙡𝙥 𝙤𝙩𝙝𝙚𝙧𝙨.
I am that person on whom you can rely on. In a team I am usually the 𝙢𝙚𝙙𝙞𝙖𝙩𝙤𝙧, always ready to share my knowledge in order to grow as a team. 
I think that in a group we are stronger and can reach higher results than alone.
Moreover I am a 𝙝𝙪𝙢𝙗𝙡𝙚 𝙥𝙚𝙧𝙛𝙚𝙘𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣𝙞𝙨𝙩 so I do my best with what I have, I am 𝙤𝙥𝙚𝙣 𝙢𝙞𝙣𝙙𝙚𝙙 and I 𝙡𝙤𝙫𝙚 𝙡𝙚𝙖𝙧𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜 and 𝙘𝙤𝙙𝙞𝙣𝙜!
